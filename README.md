# TMDBProject
A simple search website using the TMDB API that formats the results for easy reading.

Greetings! 

As probably expected, I mainly made a static html/css/js web page in order to fulfill the bulk requirements of the project. For this version, the main point of interest is the interface with the API and how it draws in and uses the data.


Included is a link to the gitpages just to temporarily show that it is a site that would run and to make it easier to access, here is that link: 
https://liliopsida.github.io/


and the github holding all of the relevant code:
https://github.com/Liliopsida/Liliopsida.github.io


If I were to develop this further I would probably figure out what the goal for the web page is. As it stands it is a fine search engine, but if the website were to be designed to do anything more it would be nice to have a web page generated for each movie that allows the end user to buy or stream. My initial theory craft for a website like that would be to use ejs template engine to make a dynamic page and send the results from the chosen movie perhaps over session data. In staying on topic for the actual requirements though, I elected to make my code much more readable and avoid overly complicating a fun project.


I really appreciated the challenge and I most likely will continue to develop this webpage since I enjoyed my time with it so far.
